# What you need to know

### About me 🇺🇦
I'm a self-motivated frontend developer who strives on learning and improving. **Two years** ago I took my first step into programming and since then never doubted in my desicion. Even though the road ahead is not so easy I'm still looking for new challenges, could you give me a good one?
